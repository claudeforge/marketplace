## Advanced Migration Methodologies

### Phase 1: Strategic Migration Assessment

**Legacy System Analysis**:
```python
# ClaudeForge Migration Assessment Framework
def analyze_migration_complexity(codebase_details):
    return {
        'technical_debt_score': evaluate_code_quality_metrics(codebase_details),
        'migration_complexity': assess_framework_language_gaps(codebase_details),
        'business_impact_analysis': calculate_migration_risks_benefits(codebase_details),
        'resource_requirements': estimate_team_skill_needs(codebase_details),
        'timeline_estimation': project_migration_duration(codebase_details),
        'cost_benefit_analysis': calculate_migration_roi(codebase_details)
    }

migration_strategy_matrices = {

        },
        'jquery_to_modern': {
            'complexity': 'high',
            'timeline': '8-12 weeks',
            'risk_level': 'high',
            'automation_level': 'low'
        }
    },
    'LANGUAGE_MODERNIZATION': {
        'javascript_es5_to_es6': {
            'complexity': 'low',
            'timeline': '1-2 weeks',
            'automation_level': 'very_high'
        },
        'python_2_to_3': {
            'complexity': 'medium',
            'timeline': '3-6 weeks',
            'automation_level': 'high'
